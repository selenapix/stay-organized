## Task Board

## Description
This project provided starter code, and I was prompted to modify and add code so that the task board functions the way it is supposed to.

This Task board will be able to allow the user to create a task, add the project and modify the to do list as they complete each task.

## Usage 
When adding a new task, the user simply has to select the "Add Task" button. Once selected, the user will be asked to fill out the modal that asks for the task title, due date, and description of the task. Once all of the information is filled out, it will then be displayed on the task board. 
Once the task is displayed on the task board, it will appear under "To do'. The user is able to drag and drop the task to whatever column matches their current state, whether that is in progress, or done. 
If the user wishes to delete a task, they can do so by selecting the "Delete" button on the task card.
